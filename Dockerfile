# Hashboard - StartOS service image
#
# Stage 1: build the Rust proxy (proxy-rs) as a static musl binary.
# rust:alpine uses musl libc by default → the resulting binary runs on any
# alpine-based image without a Rust toolchain.
# Runs once per target platform (amd64 natively, arm64 under QEMU) so the
# binary always matches the image architecture.

# Locate and copy the binary (path includes the host triple)
RUN cp "$(find /build/proxy-rs/target/release -maxdepth 1 -name proxy-rs -type f)" /usr/local/bin/proxy-rs

# Stage 2: build the Vite/React UI to static assets.
# dist/ is architecture-independent, so always build on the runner's native
# platform ($BUILDPLATFORM) instead of emulating — much faster for arm64.

#           proxy-rs (Rust, asic-rs) handles the actual miner communication on :8081.
